# Care-Centric-Staff-Scheduling-Calculator
A tool for evaluating staffing capacity. Provides a common platform for reviewing a breakout of hours and FTEs for more effective communication between nursing and finance. It also helps units/facilities to identify if they are using an identified flawed nursing FTE budget process that increases the risk of understaffing.
